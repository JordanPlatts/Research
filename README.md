# Research

This repository is meant to hold a sample of the research I have done.

Often times, the data or information I have access to through my job will be proprietary which means the majority of research that I post here will be a small subset of the work that was done.


With that said, the research posted here is intentionally public and free of conflicts. So feel free to use whatever research you find useful.
